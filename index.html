            I love to design and build software to solve real world problems. I
            balance technology with adventures, cooking, and exploring the
            world.

          <p>
            Driven by a passion for continuous learning, I embarked on my coding
            journey in 2020 and have since developed a diverse skill set in
            software design and development. My experiences span from
            foundational programming to hands-on projects in web development,
            DevOps, and AI. Currently, I am focused on mastering full-stack
            development, with a goal to create dynamic, scalable solutions. Each
            project builds on the last, adding depth to my technical expertise
            and my adaptability across evolving technologies.

          <h3 class="skill-heading">Communication and Collaboration.</h3>
          <p>
            I’m deeply committed to community engagement and building
            connections. Through various volunteer and leadership roles, I have
            actively advocated for over 1,200 Electrical, Computer, and Software
            Engineering students, managed complex event logistics with large
            budgets, and mentored peers in academic and professional growth.
            These experiences have honed my abilities to communicate
            effectively, collaborate seamlessly in teams, and lead initiatives
            that create a lasting, positive impact.
